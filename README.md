rtER: Real-Time Emergency Response
=======
*a project for the [Mozilla Ignite Challenge](https://mozillaignite.org/)*

Description
-----------
This project deals with the detection, observation, and assessment of situations requiring intervention by emergency responders, offering them access to high-quality "live" data that may be visualized effectively both by responders in-situ and by remote operators in dedicated control rooms. Its components will include multimodal data registration, interactive visualization capabilities, and live streaming of the integrated contents, potentially obtained from a wide range of heterogeneous acquisition devices, including multispectral imaging devices and handheld smartphones.
